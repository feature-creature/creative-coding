the tradition of people creating their own tools is as old as humanity itself.

further, "The tradition of artists creating their own tools is as old as art itself."
This tradition has always deepened humans knowledge of self and  knowledge of other.
and closing the gap between the two.

Computational complexity and strict IP licensing has put an abrupt halt to this inherent tradition.
a defining feature of our modern era is that much of the world around us as pre-prepared or
mass-produced. Few aspects of life have been spared from this depressing homogenization.
no one makes their own tools anymore nor knows how to.
No one fully grasps the limitations this brings to our lives.
The new tools are closed, mass-produced tools
that democratize ability and at the same time homogonize output. 
making homogonized human beings

The creation of human relationships is most
hampered by the limited malleability of our media.

We must cast out canned media.
understanding media 1997 McLuhan
There is a media spectrum of creator & audience participation 
less (hot) to more (cold).
The notable property of cool media is that they blur the
distinction subject and object, enabling the completion of each by the other.

It is therefore ironic that computers—as mass-produced putty-colored boxes,
the most quintessentially generic items of all—have the most unprecedented
potential of any technology to break this trend of homogenization, and respond
to us in ways that are uniquely individual.
We must learn how to think computationally.
Our humanity depends on it.

The finer our level of granularity, the more control we have, and also the
more work we must do to create interesting results. 

It's a tradeoff that I
truly believe is worth making. From the programmer's point of view, we are
faced with the choice of triggering something as simple as a "play" button, or
doing the hard work of developing a generative synthesis algorithm. But from
the user's point of view, we are faced with hearing the same melody...again,
and again...or hearing a sound which responds to our unique presence in the
world of information. 

My personal criteria for a tool begins with the 
questions: for how long does the tool feel to be a seamless extension of myself?
and to what depth can I feel connected to another person through it?

To answer these questions well, an interactive medium mus be so intimately
adapted to us that our awareness of it drops away when we engage with it. 
To become one.

cold media allows for humanness.



visual design is based on talents that can't be taught. There are no right
anwsers. Computation: everything we wish to know can
be taught and is already available and documented in accessible books. Use the
visual talents you posses and sieze the computational ones you may learn and use well.
