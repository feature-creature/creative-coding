Essays for 4X4: Beyond Photoshop with Code

the tradition of people creating their own tools is as old as humanity itself.
I believe it to be an integral part of the human experience.

Further, 
"The tradition of artists creating their own tools is as old as art itself."
This tradition has always deepened humans knowledge of self and knowledge of
other, bringing an end to the distinction between the two.

A defining feature of our modern era is that much of the world around us 
is pre-prepared or mass-produced in closed systems out of view. 
Few aspects of life have been spared from this depressing homogenization.
New closed, mass-produced tools promise to democratize ability for the masses, 
but at the same time end up homogonizing the scope of output.

The problem is usually framed as a quantity vs quality problem.
A watered down experience for all vs. a rich experience for few.

Unfortunately, its rarely seen that we don't have to choose between the two.
making homogonized human beings isnt necessary.

Of this modern homogenization trend, 
two driving forces are computational abstraction and
(perhaps more importantly) strict intellectual property licensing applied to that abstraction.
this has put an abrupt halt to the inherent human tradition of tool creation.

!! note that abstraction is not a bad thing, it is more of the highest
cognitive barrier of entry to tool making humans have seen so far. 

few humans know how to make their own software tools.
fewer humans actually make them.
even fewer humans fully grasps the limitations this brings to the human
experience.

!!This reminds me of that wells novel the man who can fix anything.

stunted by liscening. putting business over humanity.

!! There is no such thing as primitive man, only primitive tools.

The creation of human relationships is most
hampered by the limited malleability of our media.

McLuhan orders media in a spectrum of required audience (and subsequently creator) participation 
-- less (hot) to more (cold).

For our humanity, we must cast out "hot" media,
being passive, one-way, strictly-defined, high-resolution data experiences.
Cool media, on the otherhand, is relational, participartory, abstract (not vague),
blurring the distinction between subject and object, 
enabling the completion of each by the other.
Hot media is a lazy high.
Cool media requires humans to think and interact.
It requires humans to be human.

!!understanding media 1997 McLuhan

Modern tools are and focus on producing easier-made hot media experiences.
Hot media forces us into spectator, consumer roles instead of creator roles.
Perhaps intentionally steering humans away from more fertal cold technologies.
a passive consumer makes money, does not make a human.

The question is do humans want to work hard for a better human experiences
or settle for simplistic experiences and narritives? 
Do we want to play within predefined limits or play with the limits
themselves?

The finer our level of granular control we have over our media
dictate the richness of our human experience. 

This takes incredibly hard work, but is nowhere else more rewarding.

Exodus from hot to cold media
Is a tradeoff that I believe is worth making.
from the creator's point of view,
We are faced with the choice of triggering something as simple as a "play" button,
or doing the hard work of developing a generative synthesis algorithm. 
But from the user's point of view, 
we are faced with hearing the same melody...again and again...
or hearing a sound which responds to our unique presence in the world of information. 

This tradeoff is most powerful in the media of code.
We must learn how to think computationally.
Our humanity depends on it.

A couple questions to keep in mind when creating (from Golan Levin):

how long does the tool feel like a seamless extension of myself?
to what depth can I feel connected to another person through it?

To answer these questions well, an interactive medium must be so intimately
adapted to us that our awareness of it drops away when we engage with it. 
The goal is to become one with "the other".

cold media allows for humanness.


a note to a subsection of humans: artists.

There are no right answers in the arts.
Its based on talents and opinions that can't necessarily be taught.
This simple fact makes it an incredibly hard field to work in.
However, in computation everything we wish to know can be taught 
and is accessibly available and documented in books. 

Use the visual talents you posses.
But also sieze the computational ones you may learn and use them well.
Your and our humanity depends on it.


It is ironic that computersâ€”as mass-produced boxes,
the most quintessentially generic items of all, have the most 
potential of any technology to break this trend of homogenization


people to add to timeline:

Wassily Kandinsky's Point and Line to Plane (1926)
Gyorgy Kepes' Language of Vision (1944)
Paul Klee's Pedagogical Sketchbook (1923)
John Maeda - design by numbers


why John didn't click.

indeterminacy an important primer, but a step too short.
